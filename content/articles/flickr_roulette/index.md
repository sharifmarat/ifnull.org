If you like to browse through random Flickr photos then [Flickr Roulette](/projects/flickr_roulette/) is
the thing you are looking for.

The Roulette randomly selects one of the interesting photos (see [interestingness](https://www.flickr.com/explore/interesting/))
rather than going through all of them.

A list of photos is updated regulary using Flickr API.
