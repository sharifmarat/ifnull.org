Is is interesting how personal territories (personal, intimate and public spaces) vary depending
on the cultural differences. If you experienced living in multiple countries or with people
from different backgrounds then you probably noticed differences in sizes of personal space.

Apparently there is a special study for such things:
> Proxemics is the study of the spatial requirements of humans and animals and 
> the effects of population density on behavior, communication, and social interaction.

This term was brought by researcher Edward Hall who studied use of out spaces and how various
differences in that use can make us feel more relaxed or anxious. 

I thought about differences in personal space when I moved from Russian to United States.
After volleyball everyone usually goes to the shower. If in Russia people usually do not care
if they are naked in front of team mates then in the USA almost everyone used a towel to wrap themselves.
Showers were different also. In states showers usually have separate cabins which you can lock
which would be very unusual for Russia.

But this time these thoughts were triggered by spending a weekend with a volleball team from 
the Netherlands. The personal space is almost non-existing. For example a shower in a gym
is just a big room with 6 shower heads.
